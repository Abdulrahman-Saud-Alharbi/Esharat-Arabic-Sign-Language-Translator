Temp readme, will be fully rewritten later on but for now it's more of a check list and reminders.


Main Funtionality Code Status:
-Main: Currently only tracks hands, will be redone after implementing model, hopefully completed by feb 25th
-Data Collection: Fully implemented v1, will probably be edited after training the model for the first time
-Model SR1: Just started coding, will hopefully be done by feb 22nd


This project consists of three main parts:
1-Main Functionality: Tracking hands and translating sign language
2-Text: Formatting the tranlated text and saving it
3-Interfaces: Creating interfaces for both desktop and mobile

A last part is porting it to Android but it probably won't be a big deal or time consuming.
